## Description

This project is from Udacity's 2018 Grow With Google scholarship challenge
My goal was to build a pixel art maker with vanilla Javascript and then refactor it with jQuery

## Instructions

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
